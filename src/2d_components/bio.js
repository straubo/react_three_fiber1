                Casey Berman (he/him) is a creative technologist, developer and <span>musician</span> living in Brooklyn, New York.
				A professional saxophonist in a past life, Casey went to NYU as a Jazz Studies major. He studied with the likes of 
				Lee Konitz (of Miles Davis fame), Mark Turner, Bill McHenry, Ben Street and many more of his heroes. He has toured on three continents 
				and played at over a hundred venues, including the Kennedy Center, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Blue Note, the Jazz Gallery and countless others.
				<br></br><br></br>

				Initially a financial decision, Casey took to Youtube to learn web development, and
				 quickly developed a knack for it. Starting his technical career 
				as a front-end Angular 1 developer at a touchscreen kiosk company called MetroClick, Casey started fooling around with Unity 
				during a few development off-weeks. He quickly saw the potential and creative opportunities of working in 3D. Since then, 
				3D development and the promise of AR have been areas of focus and interest for him. <br></br><br></br>
				
				Currently, Casey works at Elephant, a creative company, as a senior creative technologist and front-end developer.
				Working almost exclusively on the Comcast account, Casey has helped push Xfinity's in-store experience into the 
				21st century using VR, AR and 3D web technologies for three years. Much of the R&D and prototyping Casey does lays the groundwork
				for in-store experiences, whether these be for the premiere and flagship stores or nationwide. For more information on Casey's work at Elephant,
				go to the Work page.

				Casey maintains a rich life of learning and making. His musical pursuits are have also gone digital - 
				Ableton and analog synthesis are now his main tools for composing and sound design. When he gets a chance,
				he rides his bike around the five boroughs, breaks things in TouchDesigner, and
				spends time with his sphynx cat, Phoebe.
