				21st century using VR, AR and 3D web technologies. Much of the R&D and prototyping Casey does lays the groundwork

				A professional saxophonist in a past life, Casey attended NYU as a Jazz Studies major. He studied with the likes of 
				Lee Konitz (of Miles Davis fame), Mark Turner, Bill McHenry, Ben Street, and many more of his heroes. He has toured on three continents 
				and played at over a hundred venues, including the Kennedy Center, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Blue Note, the Jazz Gallery and countless others.

				{/* Initially a financial decision, Casey took to Youtube to learn web development, and
				 quickly developed a knack for it. Starting his technical career 
				as a front-end Angular 1 developer at a touchscreen kiosk company called MetroClick, Casey started fooling around with Unity 
				during a few development off-weeks. He quickly saw the potential and creative opportunities of working in 3D. Since then, 
				3D development and the promise of AR have been areas of focus and interest for him. 
				<br></br><br></br> */}
				
				Casey maintains a rich life of learning and making. When he gets a chance,
				he rides his bike around the five boroughs, composes in Ableton, breaks things in TouchDesigner, and
				spends time with his sphynx cat, Phoebe.
